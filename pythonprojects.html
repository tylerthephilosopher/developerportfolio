<h1>Number guessing game</h1>
<p>The first project I worked on is a simple guess the number game between 1 and 10.  </p>
<p> we start off with a variable to hold the guess. Then we do a while loop and if-then statements within the while loop. We must do this as it has to loop through all possible conditions </p>
<p>The goal is if the person guesses wrong it should continue to ask the user to keep guessing until the answer is achieved.</p>

<p>Below is the input once the python program has been run. When the user enters a number that is too low, it outputs to the user it is too low,
  same with if the number is too high. And finally once the correct answer is chosen, the program ends with "well done" </p>

<h1>Cleaning Data </h1>
<p>Anytime you get data you must see what data types the data is stored as as well as any missing values, as missing values can result in an incorrect analysis</p>
<p> 1. (lines 1-3) First step is importing numpy, matplotlib and pandas</p>
<p> 2. (line 5) We need to read our data, it is stored as a csv file.</p>
<p> 3. (line 6) Now that we have the csv file read, its useful to see what data types we are working with</p>
<p> 4. (line 7) And finally we can see if there are any null values </p>
<img src="python1.png">
<p> Below is the output for the above code. It tells us a few facts </p>
<p> 1. There is a total of 8 columns </p>
<p> 2. 5 columns are object data types, 3 are int64 </p>
<p> In this situation there are no null values, if there were our first info about our data would tell us what column has null values</p>
<p> The isnull tells us strictly how many values are null </p>

<h1> Plotting with NumPy and Matplotlib </h1>
<p> The first step we need to do is import numpy as well as matplotlib. Then we need to create
    two variables to plot on our graph. Year and grade_avg will represent our x and y variables.
</p>

<p> Our next figure shows us the output from the above code. In the next section we will
    continue to add labels as well as dots and font/color changes.
</p>
<img src="Figure_1.png">
<p>Now we have to add some more code to show labels that have fonts and color added
</p>

The figure below is the output from the above code

<h1>Using Tkinter to create input system for school</h1>
<img src="tkinter1.png">
<p>first we import tkinter then name the program as well as give it a title</p>
<p>the function get_results() is what i did last. first we must create the layout of the program</p>
<img src="tkinter2.png">
<p>L1 - L6 are labels for the GUI, and E1-E6 are the entries where the user can input the data</p>
<img src="tkintergui1.png">
<p>This is what the gui looks like </p>
<img src="tkinter3.png">
<p>Finally we go back to our function get_results() in order to actually save data to a txt file</p>
